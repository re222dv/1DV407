Hello my friend! 

We have done a peer review of your workshop 1 and here comes our feedback:

As a developer the model helps but you don’t really know what the role that is linked to member has for meaning in the organisation but other than that it helps and it’s good associations.

As a secretary you get a good understanding on how the organisation works and how the system is going to work. The only thing that you don’t know as a secretary is who is booking the ParkingLot for the boats.

The strong points of the model is that they have a Size class that boat and ParkingLot inherit from and it is really good that Event and Calendar are for them self with only association to each other.

The only thing that we have to complain about is the naming on ParkingLot because when you first see it you think it’s about cars and not a parking for boats.

The model has passed the grade 3 criteria.
